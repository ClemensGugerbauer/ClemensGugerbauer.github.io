      <h2>Quest 1</h2>
      <p>
        Marius, Max, and their friends are in the schoolyard. Marius grabs Max’s Samsung phone and smashes it, saying he hates Samsung.
        <br>
        Imagine you are Max. How would you feel?

          1. Marius destroys Max's phone
          <br>
          Situation:
          Marius, Max, and their friends are on the schoolyard. Suddenly, Marius takes Max’s Samsung phone and destroys it. He says he doesn’t like Samsung phones and that’s why he broke it.
          <br>
          Put yourself in Max's shoes:
          Imagine someone broke your phone or another important possession just because they didn’t like it. How would you feel? Angry? Sad? Treated unfairly?
          <br><br>
          What can you do?<br>
          <strong>A)</strong> Calmly tell Marius that what he did was wrong and ask him to apologize.<br>
          <strong>B)</strong> Go to a teacher and report what happened.<br>
          <strong>C)</strong> Laugh along with Marius and say that Samsung phones are bad anyway.<br>
          <strong>D)</strong> Pretend you didn’t see anything because you don’t want to get involved.<br>
          <br><br>
          Best choices:
          A or B – Marius needs to understand that destroying someone else's property is wrong. An adult can help resolve the situation.

        "This wizard and his family must go! If not, we’ll make sure they do – just look at his scruffy hair!"

          2. Justus speaks out against the wizard
          <br>
          Situation:
          Justus says to you under the wizard's tower:
          "This wizard and his family must finally disappear! Otherwise, we’ll take care of it ourselves – just because of his scruffy hair."
          <br>
          But you know: The wizard has already helped. Maybe Justus doesn’t know that.
          <br><br>
          What can you do?<br>
          <strong>A)</strong> Calmly explain to Justus that the wizard has already helped and that it’s unfair to drive him away.<br>
          <strong>B)</strong> Ignore Justus and walk away.<br>
          <strong>C)</strong> Agree with Justus and help him get rid of the wizard.<br>
          <strong>D)</strong> Go to the wizard and warn him that Justus wants to drive him away.<br>
          <br><br>
          Best choices:
          A or D – It’s important to stand up against injustice or help the wizard if he is in danger.</p>

          <br>
          Situation:
          At the marketplace, you see Justus hitting a person with colorful hair.
          <br>
          Put yourself in their position:
          Imagine being attacked just because someone doesn’t like the way you look. That’s not fair! The person might be scared or in pain.
          <br><br>
          What can you do?<br>
          <strong>A)</strong> Step in and try to stop Justus, even if it’s dangerous.<br>
          <strong>B)</strong> Call for help immediately, such as a guard or another authority figure.<br>
          <strong>C)</strong> Look briefly but decide not to get involved – it’s none of your business.<br>
          <strong>D)</strong> Cheer Justus on and support him.<br>
          <br><br>
          Best choice:
          B) Call for help immediately. Violence is dangerous, and it’s important to get support quickly rather than put yourself in danger.</p>
